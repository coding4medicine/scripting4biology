# Introduction

A scientific field is defined by the questions asked by its practitioners. Unless life scientists with experimental training start 
analyzing their own data, their whole field will get redefined by the computational scientists interested in different kind of 
questions.  For example, persons trained in computer science like to find problems, where they can show the mastery of their computer
skills. They may not think of ways or even ask questions that could be easily answered by additional experiments, because they may
lack access to experimental facilities or lack knowledge. One can see such change toward using excessive computation to solve all
problems happening in the field of human genetics, where researchers are proposing larger and larger genome sequencing problems 
(1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 human genomes) to answer increasingly trifling questions.

On the other hand, geneticists trained with working on individual genes cannot completely ignore the large-scale datasets available 
in the post-genomic era. Such exponential increase in data was a natural outcome of the completion of genome sequencing projects 
and rapid decrease over the last decade. Currently


 It  is less recognized is that the quality of individual observations  
continues to fall with this exponential rise of data.  For example, in the 90s, protein-protein interactions were measured
at the individual gene level, but each observation reported in papers were of high-quality. Since 2000, several groups reported 
measuring protein-protein interactions at the genome-wide scale, thus giving us thousands of interaction pairs.  It turned out that 
each interaction pair in their massive data sets were noisier than more careful individualized measurements of the earlier era. 
The same is true for all kinds of large-scale data sets published since the late 90s.

The biology of new era will consist of asking biological questions, but answering them through a combination of traditional experiments
and computational/statistical analysis of high-throughput datasets. This book prepares the biologists for the second task.
