# scripting4biology

Should life scientists learn scripting languages?  Absolutely yes. Biology is increasingly becoming data intensive, and that means 
the researchers are spending more time parsing through large data files than working on the bench.  In the meanwhile, the computer 
languages and programming enviromnents are becoming easy to use and learn. R made statistical analysis and visualization straightforward, 
whereas python and PERL greatly simplified string processing and large-scale data analysis.

The current paradigm of biologists seeking help from the core facilities or specially-trained bioinformaticians for analysis of their data
is very inefficient. A recent paper discussing the work of bioinformatics core facilities wrote [1] -

"To give greater support to researchers, our centre set out to develop a series of standardized services. We documented the projects that we took on over 18 months. Forty-six of them required 151 data-analysis tasks. No project was identical, and we were surprised at how common one-off requests were (see .Routinely unique.). There were a few routine procedures that many people wanted, such as finding genes expressed in a disease. But 79% of techniques applied to fewer than 20% of the projects. In other words, most researchers came to the bioinformatics core seeking customized analysis, not a standardized package.

The above discussion reminded me of physics of the early 90s, when the theoretical physicists were not avid programmers.  When 
I joined graduate school, my professor did not know any programming and had to request his students to get all kinds of simple and 
complex calculations done.  That was frustrating for him and us, because we were busy with classes in the beginning and with our own 
research at the end. When his requests were different from our work, we had to switch mental context to write programs for him. That 
meant we could not invest as much time into exploring alternative ideas by playing with the program, as he could with full control
over the process.

What my professor did not realize was that programming was greatly simplified by tools like Matlab and Mathematica. Right after joining, 
I spent some time helping him learn Matlab, and he never had to ask anyone to do his analysis again. Moreover, Matlab was so easy that 
mostly he learned the language by himself through practicing. My role was to get him over the initial barrier and occasionally help 
him, when he got stuck.
 
Life scientists are at the same juncture today and can take care of much of their analysis on their own by learning R and some
other scripting language. This book and its associated training module are developed to help them get over the initial barrier.  This
book is written for PERL/python/GO together, but we also created equivalent notes for indivial languages available at the following
links. Moreover, we created a cloud-based environment, where they can practice  and online chat-based class for further training.
